# Advent of Code 2019

Reloaded. I got stuck at Day 4 on my first attempt in 2019.

After having enjoyed solving the [2020 edition with the Wolfram Language](https://github.com/edoardob90/aoc2020), I'm going back to 2019 and try to reach the end with Python.

### Input, solutions, and notes

Naming convention: `.input` are the actual input of my puzzle, while `.sample` files are the small tests you can check your code against before submitting your answer.

Taking inspiration from [this repo](https://github.com/Dementophobia/advent-of-code-2019), here's my summary table of 2019 puzzles

| Input | My Solution | Comments |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |

| [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) | [Solution(p1 & p2)](https://github.com/edoardob90/aoc2019/blob/main/day_2.py) | Started building a `class` for an Intcode program |
| [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) | [Solution (p1 & p2)](https://github.com/edoardob90/aoc2019/blob/main/day_3.py) | Operations with sets (mutable and *unordered* collections of *unique and immutable* objects) |
| [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4) | [Solution](https://github.com/edoardob90/aoc2019/blob/main/day_4.py) | Inspiration from the [`Tally`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Tally.html) function of the Wolfram Language |
